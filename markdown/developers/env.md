subtitle: Where and how we develop our pipelines

## GitHub usage

### Repository organisation

The default branch of our repository is called `main`, following the new GitHub convention, as opposite to `master` in [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

The `main` and `dev` branches are "protected" and can only be modified with pull-requests.

### Access

- All our pipeline repositories are public: everyone has read access.
- All sanger-tol Nextflow developers have write access to all Nextflow repositories through the [`nextflow_all`](https://github.com/orgs/sanger-tol/teams/nextflow_all) GitHub team.
  - Direct push to `main` and `dev` is not allowed, since the two branches are protected.
- A selection of people from the Informatics Infrastructure team have ["admin" access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role) to all Nextflow repositories via the [`nextflow_admin`](https://github.com/orgs/sanger-tol/teams/nextflow_admin) GitHub team..
- [@muffato](https://github.com/muffato), [@mcshane](https://github.com/mcshane), and [@andrew-varley](https://github.com/andrew-varley), are ["owners"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#permissions-for-organization-roles).
- Additional contributors can be added, if sponsored by a repository admin.

## Farm environment

The Informatics Infrastructure team maintains central installations of Nextflow.

Nextflow itself can be enabled via _modules_. This is sufficient to _run_ pipelines.
All recent major versions are installed after release (typically in April and October each year).

```
$ module load nextflow/23.10.0-5889
$ nextflow -version

      N E X T F L O W
      version 23.10.0 build 5889
      created 15-10-2023 15:07 UTC (16:07 BST)
      cite doi:10.1038/nbt.3820
      http://nextflow.io
```

To develop pipelines, the Conda environments named `nf-core-*` are more appropriate.
They expose the nf-core command-line tool, together with a Nextflow and some development helpers like `prettier` or `nf-test`.

```
$ module load conda  # if not yet loaded
$ conda activate nf-core_2.11
$ nextflow -version

      N E X T F L O W
      version 23.04.1 build 5866
      created 15-04-2023 06:51 UTC (07:51 BST)
      cite doi:10.1038/nbt.3820
      http://nextflow.io

$ nf-core --version

Java programs are not really allowed to run on the head nodes so you will have to submit all your Nextflow commands on LSF.
When developing a pipeline, you may want to do all your development from an interactive LSF job.

In our experience, `nextflow run` commands need 1 CPU and <1.2 GB RAM for themselves, but of course more if you want to use the "local" executor.
For all sanger-tol and nf-core pipelines, we recommend using the ["sanger" profile](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/conf/sanger.config)
which automatically activates LSF job submission using the appropriate queues based on each job's parameters.
When asking Nextflow to submit jobs to LSF, please submit the `nextflow run` command to the `oversubscribed` queue,
which is designed for workflow managers, that it doesn't take unnecessary compute resources.
