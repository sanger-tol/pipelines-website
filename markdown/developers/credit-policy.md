subtitle: Guidelines for crediting people's contributions
---

Here we outline, how to credit the work of others as it is incorporated into your pipeline. It is important and critical that we acknowledge those who support our work.

## In scripts

If the original concept of your script or parts of the code are borrowed, please acknowledge with a comment at the top.

```
# This script is based on https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/bin/check_samplesheet.py
or
# This script was originally conceived by @github-username
```

## In `nextflow.config`

`nextflow.config` now has space in the "manifest" for a list of "contributors".
The list should everyone who contributed one way or the other to the pipeline.
There are three levels of "contribution":

- _maintainer_
- _author_
- _contributor_

## In `README.md`

Under `Credits` in `README.md`

- Acknowledge those who wrote the scripts and local modules
- Acknowledge those who provide concepts and ideas
- Acknowledge the code reviewers and those who contributed through discussions
- Acknowledge nf-core and Nextflow Slack community members for answering queries

## In `CITATIONS.md`

List all pipeline tools with links and references.
