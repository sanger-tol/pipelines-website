# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

Introduction to Genomes on a Tree (GoaT) database.

By the end of this session you will:

1. Know what genome-relevant metadata (such as genome size, chromosome number, assembly span) are stored on GoaT
2. Understand the different indexes on GoaT (taxon and assembly) and how to query associated metadata
3. Have experience performing simple and complex queries using GoaT Web Interface to retrieve list of taxa and/or assemblies
4. Have experience viewing sequencing status and target lists for Earth Biogenome Projects
5. Create and share reports for taxon and assembly metadata

# Prerequisites

1. **Access to web via desktop** (GoaT UI is not optimized for mobile)
2. Basic knowledge of genome characteristics and descriptors (assembly, assembly span, genome size, chromosome count,
   etc.)
3. Interest in Eukaryotic genome sequencing initiatives

# More information

GoaT has been built using [GenomeHubs](https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs) to help coordinate efforts across the [Earth Biogenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org) (EBP) Network at all stages from planning through sequencing and assembly to publication.

GoaT is described in Challis et al. [announcement paper](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-24) in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org)
