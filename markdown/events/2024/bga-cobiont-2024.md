# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

Typically, when an organism is sequenced, you don't just sequence the organism of interest, you also sequence its lunch, its commensals, and its parasites - i.e. its cobionts. In this session, we will look at methods and best practices to isolate cobiont reads from a metagenomic sample, assemble them, and assess the resulting genome assembly quality. We will also explore how data mining can be carried out for cobionts of interest, and what kinds of biological insights have been possible from such efforts and cobiont genome assemblies. Tools we will use include BlobToolKit, minimap2, mummer, hifiasm, and the interactive dot plotter HyraxDotPlot.

# Prerequisites

1. Understanding of linux command line basics
