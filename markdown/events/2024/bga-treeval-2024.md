# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

TreeVal is a pipeline created to generate supplemental information which will aid in the curation of high-quality genomes.

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Install the treeval-pipeline on your system
2. Understand the data currently required for TreeVal
3. Start a treeval and curationpretext run
4. Understand what the different components of the pipeline do
5. Upload results to JBrowse and look at our data.

# Prerequisites

1. Understanding of the terms genome assembly, genome curation, HiC, genome browsers
2. Familiarity with linux command line basics (cd, mv, rm)
3. An understanding of pipelines (especially Nextflow) will be helpful
