# Welcome

Join us from **March 5-6** for the Community Nextflow Foundational Training event!

The core training is free and delivered virtually. It will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow.
While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) for the first time.

Prior knowledge of Nextflow is not required but will make it easier to understand new concepts.
