# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Understand how Smudgeplot estimates ploidy
2. Appreciate strengths and weakness of Smudgeplot
3. Run Smudgeplot and understand the input parameters
4. Critically evaluate a Smudgeplot

# Prerequisites

1. Understanding of linux command line basics
2. Knowledge of basic genome biology
3. (optional) read the smudgeplot sections of <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14998-3>
