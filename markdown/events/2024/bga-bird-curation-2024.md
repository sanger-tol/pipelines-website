# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Understand the Manual curation pipeline in regards to Bird microchromosomes
2. Understand how Jbrowse can be utilised as a tool both to aid curation and also for post curation analysis
3. Interpret a HiC Map
4. Understand how to curate an assembly using PretextView and associated curation scripts
5. Create an updated/curated assembly fasta

# Prerequisites

1. Understanding the terms genome assembly, reads, contigs
2. Understanding of linux command line basics
3. To have read/watched the rapid curation documentation available at <https://gitlab.com/wtsi-grit/rapid-curation/-/tree/main>
4. To have read through the Interpreting_HiC_maps guide
5. Have access to a 3 button mouse
