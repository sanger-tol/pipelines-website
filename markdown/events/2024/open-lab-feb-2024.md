The project of Computational Open Lab Events
has been designed after last year’s success of Open Lab Events and the feedback received.
This will be the first TC collaboration project between Management Trainees and TechTalent members.

Have you ever wondered about the skills and techniques being used by computational teams at Sanger?

Want to try out some of these skills and techniques yourself in interactive sessions?

Considering a career move into the computational world?

Book onto a Computational Open Lab Event [here](https://bookwhen.com/computational-open-lab-events) !

With a variety of sessions catering for all levels of computational experience, the Technician Commitment presents interactive workshops including:

- ToL Portal: interactive reporting hub
- Develop and train a neural network
- Running ToL bioinformatics pipelines and visualising results
- Fuzzing as a software testing technique
- Data centre tours
- GSU: A career in software development via the scenic route
- Querying genome-related metadata with GoaT
- PaM Informatics Mini-Fair
- Malaria Data Science: genomic tools and data analysis
- Genome curation with GRIT

### Booking Guidance

All events will be onsite, between Monday 5th February and Friday 16th February. Booking is on a first come, first served basis - if you need to cancel, please do this as soon as possible to enable someone else from the waiting list to attend!

Follow the link above to find out more about the events and to book places. Multiple time slots have been arranged for some events; please only book one time slot per event.

Use your Sanger email when booking – this sends the automated calendar invites to your Outlook account.
