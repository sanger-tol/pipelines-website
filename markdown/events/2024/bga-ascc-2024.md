# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2024 (BGA24) is a series of free, open to all,
nline-only, short and interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics tools and approaches that underpin the Earth BioGenome Project and the field as a whole.

More information [on our website](https://thebgacademy.org/).

# Description

The Automated System for Cobiont and Contamination detection, is an NF-Core based pipeline that allows for the detection of cobionts and contaminant sequence from a genomic assembly. This is achieved through the generation of Blobtoolkit compatible graphs for manual investigation and automated contamination removal.

# Prerequisites

1. Understanding of linux command line basics
2. An understanding of running Nextflow Pipelines
