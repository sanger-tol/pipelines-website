## Description

![favicon-32x32](https://github.com/BGAcademy23/goat/assets/13206220/6758c870-f72e-43c9-8d05-e0c47d3de052)

**Introduction to Genomes on a Tree (GoaT) database**

By the end of this session you will:

1. Know what genome-relevant metadata (such as genome size, chromosome number, assembly span) are stored on GoaT
2. Understand the different indexes on GoaT (taxon and assembly) and how to query associated metadata
3. Have experience performing simple and complex queries using GoaT Web Interface to retrieve list of taxa and/or assemblies
4. Have experience viewing sequencing status and target lists for Earth Biogenome Projects
5. Create and share reports for taxon and assembly metadata

## Prerequisites

1. **Access to web via desktop** (GoaT UI is not optimized for mobile)
2. Basic knowledge of genome characteristics and descriptors (assembly, assembly span, genome size, chromosome count,
   etc.)
3. Interest in Eukaryotic genome sequencing initiatives

!!! warning "Please make sure you MEET THE PREREQUISITES and READ THE DESCRIPTION above"

    You will get the most out of this session if you meet the prerequisites above.

    Please also read the description carefully to see if this session is relevant to you.

    If you don't meet the prerequisites or change your mind based on the description or are no longer available at the session time, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk to cancel your slot so that someone else on the waitlist might attend.

## More information

GoaT has been built using [GenomeHubs](https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs) to help coordinate efforts across the [Earth Biogenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org) (EBP) Network at all stages from planning through sequencing and assembly to publication.

GoaT is described in Challis et al. [announcement paper](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-24) in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org)
