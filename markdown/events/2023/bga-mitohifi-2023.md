# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023 (BGA23) is a series of free, open to all,
online-only, short, interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics
tools and approaches that underpin the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org/).

# Description

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Run MitoHiFi using docker
2. Understand the different steps done by MitoHiFi
3. Understand intermediate outputs
4. Cases where the pipeline fails
