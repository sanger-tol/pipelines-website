# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023 (BGA23) is a series of free, open to all,
online-only, short, interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics
tools and approaches that underpin the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org/).

# Description

By the end of this session you will:

1. Know what genome-relevant metadata (such as genome size, chromosome number, assembly span) are stored on GoaT
2. Understand the different indexes on GoaT (taxon and assembly) and how to query associated metadata
3. Have experience performing simple and complex queries using GoaT Web Interface to retrieve list of taxa and/or assemblies
4. Have experience viewing sequencing status and target lists for Earth Biogenome Projects
5. Create and share reports for taxon and assembly metadata
