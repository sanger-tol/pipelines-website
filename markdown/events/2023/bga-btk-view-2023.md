# Introduction

Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023 (BGA23) is a series of free, open to all,
online-only, short, interactive sessions on how to use the bioinformatics
tools and approaches that underpin the [Earth Biogenome Project (EBP)](https://earthbiogenome.org/).

# Description

TreeVal is a pipeline created to generate supplemental information which will aid in the curation of high-quality genomes.

By the end of this session you will be able to:

1. Install the treeval-pipeline on your own system
2. Understand the data currently required for TreeVal
3. Start a treeval and curationpretext run
4. Understand what the different components of the pipeline do
5. Upload results to JBrowse and look at our data.
