This seminar series will introduce participants to the process of creating reference genomes, a critical tool in understanding the genetic makeup of species across the tree of life. We will explore the entire pipeline, from the initial collection of biological samples to the analysis and interpretation of genomic data. Each session will cover a key step in the process, breaking down complex concepts into easily understandable segments. Topics include sample submission, DNA extraction, sequencing technologies, genome assembly, annotation, and the importance of reference genomes for fields such as evolutionary biology, conservation, and medicine. The series is designed for all audiences, with no prior experience required, and aims to provide a clear and accessible understanding of how genomic reference data is generated and utilized in modern science.

The talks will be delivered by members of the Tree of Life programme and colleagues from Sequencing Operations and EBI, offering unique insights and expertise.
