  - full_name: Tree of Life
    short_name: ToL
    description: >
      The Tree of Life Programme investigates the diversity of complex organisms (eukaryotes - organisms that have a nucleus) through sequencing and cellular
      technologies. We generate and use high-quality genome sequences to explore the evolution of life, provide the raw materials for new biotechnology and 
      deliver tools and understanding for biodiversity conservation.

  - full_name: Vertebrate Genome Lab
    short_name: VGL
    description: >
      The Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) is a genomic-focused lab at the
      Rockefeller University. The main goal of the VGL is to serve as one the data
      production and assembly hubs for the  Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). We
      specialize in long-read and long-range sequencing technologies. Our lab hosts
      several of the latest sequencing technologies as well as computing resources
      for genome assemblies. Our team is composed of field biologists, molecular
      biologists, and bioinformaticians encompassing all the required skills and
      talents for generating high-quality reference genomes.
